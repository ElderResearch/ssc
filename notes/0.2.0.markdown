## New Features

* Added support for HOCON array values through `as[Seq[T]]` and `asOption[Seq[T]]`
* Converted value extraction to use user-extensible typeclass pattern. See [README](https://github.com/ElderResearch/ssc#defining-new-readers) for details.

## Changes

* `README` examples processed with [`tut`](https://github.com/tpolecat/tut). (Thanks @tpolecat) 
 
## Breaking Changes
 
* `asSize` has gone away in preference for `as[ConfigMemorySize]`, which normalizes it's usage with rest of API.
